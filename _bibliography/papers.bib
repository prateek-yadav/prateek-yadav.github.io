  abstract =   {In many real-world network datasets such as co-authorship, co-citation, email communication, etc., relationships are complex and go beyond pairwise. Hypergraphs provide a flexible and natural modeling tool to model such complex relationships. The obvious existence of such complex relationships in many real-world networks naturaly motivates the problem of learning with hypergraphs. A popular learning paradigm is hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) where the goal is to assign labels to initially unlabeled vertices in a hypergraph. Motivated by the fact that a graph convolutional network (GCN) has been effective for graph-based SSL, we propose HyperGCN, a novel GCN for SSL on attributed hypergraphs. Additionally, we show how HyperGCN can be used as a learning-based approach for combinatorial optimisation on NP-hard hypergraph problems. We demonstrate HyperGCN's effectiveness through detailed experimentation on real-world hypergraphs.}

    abstract =   {Word embeddings have been widely adopted across several NLP applications. Most existing word embedding methods utilize sequential context of a word to learn its embedding. While there have been some attempts at utilizing syntactic context of a word, such methods result in an explosion of the vocabulary size. In this paper, we overcome this problem by proposing SynGCN, a flexible Graph Convolution based method for learning word embeddings. SynGCN utilizes the dependency context of a word without increasing the vocabulary size. Word embeddings learned by SynGCN outperform existing methods on various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks and provide an advantage when used with ELMo. We also propose SemGCN, an effective framework for incorporating diverse semantic knowledge for further enhancing learned word representations. We make the source code of both models available to encourage reproducible research.}

  abstract = 	 {Semi-supervised learning on graph structured data has received significant attention with the recent introduction of Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). While traditional methods have focused on optimizing a loss augmented with Laplacian regularization framework, GCNs perform an implicit Laplacian type regularization to capture local graph structure. In this work, we propose Lovász Convolutional Network (LCNs) which are capable of incorporating global graph properties. LCNs achieve this by utilizing Lovasz's orthonormal embeddings of the nodes. We analyse local and global properties of graphs and demonstrate settings where LCNs tend to work better than GCNs. We validate the proposed method on standard random graph models such as stochastic block models (SBM) and certain community structure based graphs where LCNs outperform GCNs and learn more intuitive embeddings. We also perform extensive binary and multi-class classification experiments on real world datasets to demonstrate LCN’s effectiveness. In addition to simple graphs, we also demonstrate the use of LCNs on hyper-graphs by identifying settings where they are expected to work better than GCNs. }

  abstract = 	 {Predicting properties of nodes in a graph is an important problem with applications in a variety of domains. Graph-based Semi Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim to address this problem by labeling a small subset of the nodes as seeds, and then utilizing the graph structure to predict label scores for the rest of the nodes in the graph. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive performance on the graph-based SSL task. In addition to label scores, it is also desirable to have confidence scores associated with them. Unfortunately, confidence estimation in the context of GCN has not been previously explored. We fill this important gap in this paper and propose ConfGCN, which estimates labels scores along with their confidences jointly in GCN-based setting. ConfGCN uses these estimated confidences to determine the influence of one node on another during neighborhood aggregation, thereby acquiring anisotropic1 capabilities. Through extensive analysis and experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that ConfGCN is able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines. We have made ConfGCN’s source code available to encourage reproducible research. }

	abstract = {Link prediction in simple graphs is a fundamental problem in which new links between nodes are predicted based on the observed structure of the graph. However, in many real-world applications, there is a need to model relationships among nodes which go beyond pairwise associations. For example, in a chemical reaction, relationship among the reactants and products is inherently higher-order. Additionally, there is need to represent the direction from reactants to products. Hypergraphs provide a natural way to represent such complex higher-order relationships. Even though Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have recently emerged as a powerful deep learning-based approach for link prediction over simple graphs, their suitability for link prediction in hypergraphs is unexplored -- we fill this gap in this paper and propose Neural Hyperlink Predictor (NHP). NHP adapts GCNs for link prediction in hypergraphs. We propose two variants of NHP --NHP-U and NHP-D -- for link prediction over undirected and directed hypergraphs, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, NHP-D is the first method for link prediction over directed hypergraphs. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we show NHP's effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Several real-world problems including network influence maximization, rank aggregation, etc. can be posed as problems that output a good ranking of a set of items. We introduce a unifying algorithmic framework based on a novel notion called rank refinement of monotonic set functions to tackle such problems. We prove that under very mild monotonicity assumptions the proposed algorithm converges to a stable ranking. We show that IMRank, a highly scalable influence maximization algorithm can be derived as a special case of our framework. By careful choice of the monotonic set functions, we derive novel generalizations of IMRank that balances the influence and diversity of the top-ranked nodes without compromising on scalability. We provide extensive experimental analysis on both synthetic data-sets based on stochastic block models and large scale real-world data-sets to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.}

  title =    {Discrete Time Latent Hawkes Processes for ModelingMultidimensional Temporal Event Streams},
  author =   {{Yadav}, Prateek and {Sankaran}, Raman and {Dutta}, Partha and {Bhatt}, Rushi},
  journal = {under review},
  year={2020},
  abstract =   {Multidimensional event streams are common in many applications such as content on social platforms. Existing models using Hawkes processes and its variants often ignore important information about the causal parents of the events, which typically is readily available in social media applications. These models also ignore the disproportionate response created by some of the rare events, such as the impact of a ``like'' on a content by an influencer. Addressing these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian dIscRete Time Hawkes (BIRTH) model, a Bayesian generative model for multidimensional event streams data with causal information. Through its latent variables, BIRTH is flexible enough to capture contrasting responses invoked by multiple events of the same type. Moreover, being a discrete-time model, the latent parameters scale as $O(\#Time bins)$ in BIRTH as compared to $O(\#events)$ for continuous-time processes, thus scaling better in the settings when the number of events is huge. For inference, we propose a Gibbs sampling based inference procedure for BIRTH, which is suitable when the whole data can be processed together. While a full variational inference procedure is difficult to arrive at due to non-conjugate factors in the posterior, we propose a Stochastic hybrid Gibbs-Variational Inference (SVI) algorithm, which is beneficial in the settings where Gibbs might be expensive in terms of memory requirements. SVI has per-iteration memory complexity proportional to the chosen minibatch size, and also extends easily for online streaming settings of the data. We thoroughly evaluate BIRTH's abilities over both synthetic and real-world social network event streams. Specifically, on synthetic datasets we demonstrate model fitting, recovery of planted structure and identification of the rare events. For a social network dataset we show significantly higher likelihoods along with rare event identification.}
