Hey, I am a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Madras under the guidance of [Prof. Arun Rajkumar](https://sites.google.com/view/arun-rajkumar){:target="_blank"}. My research goal is to better understand deep learning models which would enable us to make them more roboust and efficient. I am particularly interesed in representation learning and natural language models. Current focus of my research is on developing deep learning techniques on structured data. I also wish to learn more about Optimization, Reinforcement learning.

Over the past few years, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net){:target="_blank"} at Machine and Language Learning Lab and I have also spent some time at Microsoft Research, India. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics in 2018 from [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} and my bachelor's thesis was supervised by [Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Kaushal Verma](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~kverma/){:target="_blank"}. 

Check out my [publication](/publications/) page to know more about my current research. I am also actively involved in improving the way science is taught to students, through simple experiments, and conducting workshops via [Notebook Drive](https://www.iisc.ac.in/outreach/activities/notebook-drive/){:target="_blank"}.
